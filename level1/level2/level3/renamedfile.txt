Spark runs on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OS), and it should run on any platform that runs a supported version of Java. This should include JVMs on x86_64 and ARM64. It’s easy to run locally on one machine — all you need is to have java installed on your system PATH, or the JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a Java installation.

Spark runs on Java 8/11, Scala 2.12, Python 2.7+/3.4+ and R 3.5+. Java 8 prior to version 8u92 support is deprecated as of Spark 3.0.0. Python 2 and Python 3 prior to version 3.6 support is deprecated as of Spark 3.0.0. For the Scala API, Spark 3.0.1 uses Scala 2.12. You will need to use a compatible Scala version (2.12.x).
